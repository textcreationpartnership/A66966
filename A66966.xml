            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Perſon therefore was ſent to prepare the world, that they ſhould, not with any ſecular ſtate or external magnificent ſhews, but with pure Souls and reformed manners (with which entertainment only this heavenly King was taken) meet and receive this moſt Holy Prince; and therefore He was ordered to appear not in feaſting, or in glorious array, or in ſome rich and ſtately Court or populous City or Pallace, but in that moſt rigid faſting, and in rough apparel, and in an uncultivated deſert.

Put to death by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod partly out of religion too, to keep his oath forſooth, as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was by the Jews to preſerve their Law.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99134:28"/>but alſo as a door of entrance into the Church, family, and houſhold of God, and into a new Covenant with God for the time to come; by which, from Abrahams daies till the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our redemption, this family was diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of the world; and a ſtrict pact, and Covenant paſſed between God, and all ſuch perſons, for the future; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they engaged themſelves on their parts to walk ſincerely in his laws, in newneſs of life, as his obedient Children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving then as it were a new nature, as well as a name: and God engaged on his part, to be their Father, and protector, and exceeding great reward in beſtowing upon them the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and poſſeſſion of an heavenly Canaan.

A new Star, for ſome time before our Saviours birth, had appeared in the heavens, probably of an extraordinary ſplendor and brightneſs, ſuitable to the perſon whom it prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticated. Which by the Orientals, much given to Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, was ſoon diſcerned; and raiſed in them a great devotion and earneſt addreſſes to the Divine Majeſty, Creator of the Univerſe, to know, for the preſignification of what ſtrange effect he had ſent it. Whereupon, probably by ſome ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made to them in the Eaſt, as they received afterward in Judea concerning their return <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.12; they were aſſured of the Birth of this Meſſias, or great King, to whom all the world ſhould become tributary and ſubject. Of which Prince alſo it is likely, in ſo general an expectation of the Jews as then was, that they had heard, or alſo read ſomething former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therefore theſe firſt believers of the Gentiles, crediting all things of this Prince worthy ſo ſupereminent a dignity, and being perſons of high condition (as the Magi in thoſe Countries ordinarily were, if not Princes) made haſt to be amongſt the firſt, that ſhould profeſs their ſubjection and feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Him. And, as the Orientals uſually do not approach great Perſonages without ſome preſent, prepared ſome ſmall quantity, portable in a journy, of the richeſt Gifts their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was famed for, wherewith to preſent Him. And ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth upon this divine Indication, either from ſome near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of Chaldea or of Arabia Felix, which lies ſome ſix daies journy Eaſtward from Jeruſalem: (whence alſo the Queen of Sheba, (Arabia alſo being called Ethiopia. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.1.)

And well might the Jews at leaſt, when our Lord afterward at thirty years of age publickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them, have reflected on this Star, and the ſearch of theſe Oriental Sages, and Herods ſlaughter, punctually agreeing with his Nativity.

And Here we may alſo the more admire in ſo great perfections of his Soul his divine patience, for our ſakes, of ſo many debilities and infirmities of the Body for ſo long a time enduring them, when he perfectly, apprehended, and was ſenſible-of them all; and when hindred by them from ſpeaking or acting things ſutable to his underſtanding.

Such a perfection, and, if I may ſo ſay, man-hood of our Lords Soul, and intellect being ſuppoſed in his infancy, and ſo much vacancy from any ſerious external employments as accompanies child-hood; we may imagine but Lord to have paſſed thoſe his firſt daies continually in praier (which alſo infers ſilence and Recollection), and in Interceſſions to his Father for Man's ſalvation, and the buſineſs he came for into the world. Which alſo may be inferred from this, That, when at 30 years of age, he had entred on his Office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that his day-time was taken up with other buſineſs, and great throngs of people, who for their ſpiritual and corporal neceſſities continually flocked to him, yet He uſed then to riſe on nights, and retire into ſome ſolitary place, and there ſpend part or ſometimes the whole night in Praier. See <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.35. —<hi>Luk.</hi> 5.16.—6.12.</p>
               <p>Till then that our Lords growth was capable of corporal
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99134:46"/>Labours, we may juſtly account his time at Nazareth ſpent much-what like that of S.

And his Father, who was alwaies well pleaſed in him, accepted his ſervice, in this time of nonage and ſequeſtration from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, as more immediatly devoted to himſelf. And if mankind is ſuppoſed to receive much benefit from the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Devotions of thoſe Holy Hermits, who, without any converſation with men, apply themſelves wholly to theſe; like Moſes in the Mount, praying whilſt their brethren are fighting here with Satan and a thouſand temptations; how much more ſtrength and ſuccour may we be thought to receive from thoſe infinitely-meritorious interceſſions of our Lord in that his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent infancy?

Both theſe perſons being, before our Lords Nativity, highly enriched with the Graces of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and alſo, by ſo near acceſs to his perſon, receiving daily new influences and recruits thereof from him, who was full of Grace and Truth, (as the beloved Evangeliſt deſcribes him <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.14, 16); and of whoſe fulneſs we all receive, Grace after Grace; and all for, and from, this fountain of Grace.</p>

For firſt, it may be gathered from S.

(when the caſe is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with any of us). Again, from S. Lukes ſaying, as, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, that he waxed ſtrong in Spirit, and was filled with Grace and wiſdom; ſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 52, that he increaſed in favour with God and man [i. e. as he grew elder, he more and more did things acceptable both to God and men. —<hi>Non quod ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctior aut gratior</hi> (ſaith Cardinal Tolet) <hi>progreſſu temporis fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſed quod, pro aetatis incremento, perfectioribus gratiae &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitatis operibus incubuerit;</hi> or [<hi>ſapientiora verba &amp; opera pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferret apud,</hi> or <hi>coram Deo &amp; hominibus;</hi> as the Sun, alwaies equally full of light and heat, yet is ſaid to increaſe them as it draweth nearer to us and we more partake them.] I ſay
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99134:51"/>from <hi>verſ.</hi> 52 compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. that in the 12th year of his age the Doctors and people in the Temple were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his underſtanding and anſwers, may be gathered; that during this time of his minority in his words and actions he diſcovered and ſent forth continually many raies of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite prudence, Sanctity and charity; not only before his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and S.

Tho this miracle in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na may notwithſtanding ſtill be ſaid the firſt, i. e. publick one, done by him after his beginning, when Baptized, to manifeſt himſelf unto the world, (unleſs here we will ſay the Bleſſed Virgin had ſome particular Revelation before-hand of this firſt miracle of her Son). Nor may ſuch Domeſtick Miracles in his youth be thought to anticipate the time appointed by his Father for ſhewing ſuch works, any more, then his diſputes and anſwers to the Doctors at 12 years old the conſtituted ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Publick preaching.

For our Lord thought fit to do it more privatly, none knowing thereof but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; upon which alſo, perhaps intimated to her, it was, that ſhe ſpake to them to do what he appointed. But however, if this be here underſtood of publick Miracles, it oppoſeth not his doing them privatly, and within his own family even from and in his Infancy upon neceſſary occaſions.</p>

He preſently (ſet all on fire) to carry it more forward went to ſeek out Nathaniel, an intimate friend of his, and it ſeems alſo a man of letters. Who is probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured from his early calling here, and from <hi>Jo.</hi> 21.1, 14. to have bin one of our Lords twelve Apoſtles, called Bartholomew, ſo as Simon Peter is Bar-Jona: in which Roll of them he is ſtill coupled to Philip. See 2. <hi>Part.</hi> §. whom eſpying alone under a fig-tree (perhaps at his Devotions) he called him to him, and told him the Meſſias, that Moſes and the Prophets had ſpoken ſo much of, was come into the world, and that this perſon was Jeſus of Nazareth the ſon of Joſeph. For thus much he and the reſt had learnt concerning our Lord's ſecular condition. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel (as the more learned commonly are leſs credulous) put a check to Philips forwardneſs, eſpecially when naming Moſes and the Prophets to him; telling him that ſurely there was no Prophet, that foretold the Meſſias ſhould come out of Nazareth (which thing indeed was a great blind not only to Nathaniel here, but generally to the learned Jews that they would not believe Jeſus the Chriſt; and ſo darkned in this, proceeded to fulfil the other prophecies in working his death.) Philip, without farther diſute, bid him but approach to him, and he would be abundantly ſatisfied. So ſoon as our Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, he manifeſted to him his exact knowledg (whom he ſaw wavering in faith) of all the former courſe of his life; and that he ſaw him and what he was doing when alone under the Fig-tree before Philip called him. To this omniſcience of our Lord, Nathaniel now (as Simon Peter a little before) aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereat, yeilds up himſelf and contemning his ſcruple about Nazareth, made a moſt noble Confeſſion of our Lord (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from the ſame Spirit of God in him), as S.

               <p>Our Lords Mother perceiving it, and ſolicitous of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to whom ſhe had ſo near relation, preſently told our Lord of it, expecting he ſhould relieve them herein, (either from his doing formerly ſome ſuch domeſtick and private miracles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome neceſſity in his youth at Nazareth, or from the Holy Virgin's having ſome prerevelation concerning this future fact. By our Lords reply we may conjecture, that this was ſpoken by his Mother before ſome of his Diſciples or Kindred, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the midſt of ſome Diſcourſe, when as our Bleſſed Lady imagined ſome urgent neceſſity thereof.

And thus frequently he takes occaſion to Vindicate his Divinity and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Original, to beget early in his followers a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his perſon and authority, and omniſcient conduct. Some ſuch anſwer as here he gives alſo to his Kindred <hi>Jo.</hi> 7.6. when they minding him of going up to Jeruſalem at the feaſt, and ſhewing his ſtrange works there: ſaying, my time is not yet come.

Thus raiſing them to ſtill higher thoughts concerning him. And we ſee, for fulfilling the end of his coming into the world, what a diſtance he kept alſo from his Coſin the Baptiſt. And it may be obſerved alſo, that upon all occaſions he ſhewed laying-aſide any indulgence, or carnal reſpects, or indearments for his kindred, and a perfect abſtraction from any inordinate affection to them, (ſee that place <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.48.) for our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſeeing how many are drawn to offend God, and looſe their own Souls to humour, to gratify, to provide for, to enrich ſuch their near Relations.

And the like was his practice at Gethſemane, at the foot of Mount Olivet, at the times when he preached in Jeruſalem. Yet ſurely ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips our Lord underwent, not neceſſitated thereto, either for want of friends, and benefactors, who had obliged ſo many with his miracles, or alſo of an inheritance (though this ſmall) from his parentage; but ſuch poverty and dereliction of all things he rather choſe, for a ſingle attendance, without any other ſolicitudes, or embarraſments whatever on the Goſpel, becauſe the labourer he knew, at leaſt from the Divine proviſion, could not want his ſalary, viz. neceſſaries; and alſo for a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the like condition to others that deſired to be more perfect.

Whereupon he ſtreight rebuked the Wind, and the Sea, ſaying, Peace be ſtill; and then blamed them not for repairing to him in this their danger, but for their great fear, and want of faith, as he doth very frequently: want of faith in God; who expects a confidence in him (which alſo cannot be without ſome degree of love of him) not only in the juſt and his Servants, but alſo in ſinners (among whom alſo the juſt ought to reckon themſelves) a confidence ſutable to the moſt vigilant Divine providence, extended not only to the good, but to all the Creation.

Upon which the impotent man was inſtantly cured, and carrying his bed on the Sabbath, was preſently queſtioned by the Jews (probably theſe inquirers being either the Phariſees, great zelots for the Sabbath, or ſome of their Diſciples) for the breach of it in ſo doing; who anſwered them, that he was bid to do ſo by the perſon that cured him. But our Lord, there being a throng of people in the place, he preſently conveyed himſelf away, and returned into the Temple. All which occaſioned the cure to be more taken notice of, and the perſon looked after that had done it; nor could the poor man give any account of him. But a little after he repairing alſo to the Temple, probably there to render more ſolemn thanks to God for his cure, Our Lord now diſcovers himſelf to him, and minding him of the mercy he had received, exhorted him to amendment of life, leaſt a worſe thing yet ſhould happen unto him [<hi>in die irae</hi> if not in this,<note place="margin">

               <p>On the firſt Sabbath ſucceeding the Paſchal feaſt [as S. Lukes word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is commonly underſtood, in reckoning in the ſeven Sabbaths till Pentecoſt, from the ſecond day of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal-feaſt]. On this, or ſome other ſo called, Our Lord with his diſciples, perhaps in his removal now towards Galilee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the feaſt ended, (or, as ſome think, in his going from Mount Olivet through the vale to Jeruſalem;) paſſed through ſome corn-fields; probably in going to ſome Synagogue, there to inſtruct the people, as was his ordinary practice on the Sabbath; and as may be conjectured from the multitude of people that followed him, and among them ſome Phariſees, who quitted him not, watching moſt narrowly all his waies, words, and actions, for materials of accuſation againſt him. Now ſome ſhorter journeys on the Sabbath were not diſallowed, becauſe of repairing to the publick places of Gods ſervice, when at ſome diſtance from mens habitations. In this field, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or ſome of them at leaſt, being much an hungred, began, as they paſſed, to pluck the eares of corn, and ſo rubbing them in their hands, to eat it; a thing indulged by the law to any travellers, through their Neighbours corn. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.25. and a thing commonly done, had it not bin on the Sabbath; and ſo this labour done in it, Viz. of rubbing the eares in their hands. For it ſeems on other Feſtival daies, beſides the ſeventh day of the week, (which feſtivals were alſo called Sabbaths See <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.11, 15.24, 32.) though in theſe alſo they were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the doing of any ſervile work, yet they might then do any thing relating to preparing their diet, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.16. But
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99134:97"/>on the ſeventh day they were prohibited any work whatever. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.7. comp. 3. even in order alſo to their daily food, as to making any fire for dreſſing it, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. Though this again could not be ſo ſtrictly underſtood, as that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be uſed on that day in order to our diet, as the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying or ſetting it on a Table, the cutting of it into pieces, or putting it in their mouths. And the Diſciples food here ſeems to be a proviſion ready-dreſſed, there only remaining their pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of the ear to put it in their Mouths. The Phariſees, ſtreight obſerving this their rubbing of the eares, inſtead of any Compaſſion toward the poor diſciples, who endured much hardſhip, both as to diet and lodging, in this ambulatory life of the Lord they waited on, fell on quarrelling again at their breach herein of the Sabbath, and hereof made their complaint to our Lord.</p>
               <p>To whom he anſwered, but out of the Scriptures, ſeveral things, all intimating that theſe zelots were too ſtrict and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in this matter. He repreſented to them then, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, in a kind of neceſſity, was excuſed in eating of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Bread, and prohibited to any ſave the Prieſts: That the Prieſts in the Temple on the Sabbath-daies, for the neceſſary performance of their office, profaned the Sabbath, Viz. in the work of repairing the fire on the Altar, killing and preparing the Sacrifices, &amp;c. and were blameleſs herein; whence the Jewiſh proverb, that —<hi>In Templo non eſt Sabbathum:</hi> which Temple if it excuſed them, that there was here one greater than the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the attendance on whom, and the wanting of other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proviſion, might excuſe the Diſciples in this fact. That himſelf was Lord and Author alſo of the Sabbath, (as alſo of the whole law) and a Judg of the true obſervance or breach thereof; (our Lord taking occaſion every where to let them know who he was, that ſo they might believe in, and have ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by, him). And that the Sabbath being made for the benefit of man, the reſt thereof was not extended to deprive him of any neceſſaries. And beſides theſe, he preſſed them again with that place in Hoſee —<hi>I will have mercy and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> —Herein upbraiding their hypocritical pretences of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, religious ceremonies, and the worſhip of God, to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance works of mercy and charity; which on this day, as to others, ſo much more may be performed to our ſelves; and this in particular of repairing our bodies therein with neceſſary ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance: that therefore if they had well known what that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99134:97"/>meant, they would not have condemned the guiltleſs. Thus our Lord, where his urging <hi>miſericordiam volo non ſacrificium,</hi> and Davids, and the Prieſts fact in a caſe of neceſſity, argues his diſciples, though tis probable in a morning (as his own hungring was <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.18.) much pinched with hunger; and that in this ambulatory and Pilgrim life, they made many poor meals and miſſed many; and ſo their Maſter too; And that the ſame happened to them for lodging. And therefore he forewarned the Scribe that would attend on him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.19. what he muſt expect.</p>

Our Lord now returned into Galilee, and probably to Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, went, as uſually, into their Synague and taught. Now there ſtood before him a man that had his right hand withered. And the Phariſees obſerving it, and nothing bettered by our Lords late anſwer to them, watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, that they might have (ſaith the Text) ſtill more accuſation againſt him. Our Lord perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wicked thoughts, having firſt called forth the perſon, and ſet him in the midſt of the Aſſembly, as an object of great pity, before he cured him; and that he might do it, as it were, with their good leave and conſent, or with the more ſhame and confuſion to them, asked them what they thought of it; whether it was lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do evil, to ſave life or to deſtroy it (there being no medium between <hi>bene &amp; male facere,</hi> in any neceſſity of our neighbour; the non-releiving of which, if in our power, is a ſin); to which they being ſilent, not only to let him go forward in his purpoſe, but becauſe they knew not what ſafely to anſwer: he demanded further, who among them having one Sheep faln into a pit, would not ſtreight go, lay hold of it, and pull it out on the the Sabbath: and then how much a man better than a ſheep, and a greater charity this, where leſs our own intereſt? And thus (ſaith the Text) when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts: upon his only bidding the man ſtretch forth his hand, and his doing ſo, it was reſtored whole as the other. Where it ſeems ſomewhat hard to find a breach of the Sabbath, as to any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral work. Our Lord held his hands ſtill, touched him not, only ſpake to him: the man ſtretched out his hand; and who doth not this on the Sabbath without guilt? yet it appears they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99134:98"/>were, though ſilenced, not ſatisfied, but rather more filled with madneſs.</p>

With theſe then the Phariſees conſulted how they might deſtroy our Lord, and that preſently, as appears by his ſuddain removal out of that place, which (probably) was Capernaum. From whence he went (as he uſed) to the Sea of Tiberias, giving order to his diſciples, that a ſmall ſhip ſhould wait upon him, ſo to avoid the preſs of the people, and more commodiouſly to teach them out of the ſhip. For an infinite multitude of them from all Quarters, from the coaſts of Tyre and Sidon, and of the other ſide of Jordan, and from Idumea, as well as Judea, and Galilee, followed him what way ever he moved. Partly for hearing his moſt admirable and raviſhing diſcourſes, and prudent anſwers, partly for having their ſick cured by him; cured without ſuffering any repulſe or delay; and all diſeaſes whatever equally remedied, and no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for it than only the touching of him. Which thing alſo cauſed the greater preſs upon him, and forced him to the help of a ſhip.

And therefore, that it even our right eye, or right hand ſhould be the inſtrument or tempter to offend God in ſuch a manner, it were better (if we could procure no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of committing ſuch ſin without doing this) even to pluck out this, though our right, eye, or cut off our right hand, than to ſin againſt God, and ſo have not this eye or hand only loſt, but our whole Body caſt for ſuch offence into eternal flames.

That indeed it had bin ſaid among them formerly, that they ſhould love their Neighbour, and hate their enemy: (See <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.29, the Lawyer harping upon it, who, to juſtify himſelf in this point, asked, who was his Neighbour, and our Lord, to inſtruct him herein, inſtanced in one profeſſed enemy ſhewing mercy on another, a Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan on a Jew.) And perhaps the Phariſees and people were induced to ſuch a perſwaſion from Gods commanding them to cut off the Nations, who were by him ſentenced to ſuch a deſtruction; that the ſeverity thereof might be a warning to themſelves if in like manner offending. But herein the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites indeed were only Executioners of Divine juſtice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commands; and without doubt ought to have done this thing with all pitty, and without any hate toward theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, or any men whatever, or any other of Gods creatures; who are all to be loved for his ſake. And the law plainly taught, and the Saints under it practiſed, the contrary to this Phariſaical corruption: See <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4. -<hi>Job.</hi> 31.29. -<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.4. -35.14. -<hi>Prov.</hi> 24.17.-25.21. quoted by S.

Our Lord therefore informs them, that their enemies alſo, without any diſtinction, were to be reckoned amongſt their Neighbours, and ſo they were alſo to love them as themſelves; do good to thoſe that hated them; bleſs thoſe that curſed (which thing was punctually practiſed afterwards by theſe his diſciples. —<hi>Being reviled we bleſs, being defamed we intreat, being perſecuted we ſuffer it, and reſiſt not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12, 13.) and that they ſhould pray for thoſe that deſpitefully uſe and perſecute them (as our Lord did on the Croſs, and St. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen in his lapidation). For that if they loved only the lovers of them; did good, gave, or lent mony to thoſe returning to them again the like favours; what extraordinary thanks or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward could they expect from God, for this, uſual amongſt the worſt of men, Publicans and Heathens? but for doing this to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99134:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>others (where nature ſo much relucts) their reward ſhould be great, and they truely the children of the moſt high, and much reſembling him herein; who every day makes his Sun to riſe upon, and his raine to deſcend for, the unjuſt, and his enemies; and is kind unto the unthankful and evil; and is the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler of, and peace-maker in, the world: and of peace-makers he ſaid before that they ſhall ſpecially be called his children.</p>

For this was the ſumm of what the laws enjoyned as to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Further, to enforce this, he alfo aſſured them, that tho they were not to do to others what others in any kind of evil did to them; Yet that whatever they did to others, the ſame ſhould be done again to them: and as they meted in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and carriage to others in good or evil, in forgiving and giving to them, or in ſmiting, or robbing them, it ſhould be meaſured to them again (Gods juſtice taking great care of it, as he did before, being complained-to of the mans paying the laſt farthing) an exact meaſure, full, preſſed down, and ſhaken together, and running over: and this done to them by others, Gods inſtruments therein, though they ſaw no cauſe to expect or fear it from the ſame perſons, to whom themſelves had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done good, or harm: that therefore on this account, they ſhould alſo forbear judging, cenſuring, or condemning others, that themſelves might not be ſo. And that they ſhould rather endeavour to ſee the greater faults in themſelves, than blame the ſmaller of their Neighbours; and to caſt the beam out of their own eye, before they pick the motes out of other mens; that otherwiſe in their attempting to rectify, lead and guide others, whilſt themſelves alſo are blinded, the end thereof will only be their falling both into the pit.</p>

But our Lord told his, that theſe duties, to be recompenced by God, were to be ſo cleanſed from all applauſe from men, as that in the diſtributing of their Almes, if it were poſſible, the left hand ſhould not know what the right was doing: and that in faſting, they ſhould rather diſguiſe it by waſhing their face and anointing their Head: and in their prayer, that they ſhould betake themſelves to their Cloſet, and ſhut the door after them: for that thus the more they endeavoured to hide their work, the more would God, that ſeeth all ſecret things, manifeſt it in a publick rewarding thereof.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99134:108"/>were the Salt of the earth, which he had provided for ſeaſoning the inſipidneſs and unſavorineſs thereof towards God, and for preſerving it eternally from corruption: and that they were the light of the world, for illuſtrating its darkneſs: And laſtly, a City or Society, in which all the world were to be joyned and collected, and to become Subjects and members thereof, and one Body or Corporation, one Faith, one Spirit &amp;c, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. that therefore they were to provide, that this Salt ſhould not become unſavory or inſipid: for then, wherewith could that, which is to ſeaſon all others, be ſeaſoned it ſelf; And that this light ſhould not be put under a buſhel; nor this their City hid as it were in a vale, or ſuch which ſhould not be eminently diſcovered; for then, how could the world know where to joyn themſelves to the communion thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that alſo their light and their doctrine were to be accompanied with their good works; that people might ſee the one as well as the other; (though ſuch good works not done to be ſeen of men; nor that themſelves, but their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, working ſuch Sanctification in them, might be glorified thereby 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.21.-<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17.)

               <p>[Which rule our Lord ſeems to have given them upon a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account: Both becauſe truth and goodneſs, or Holineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſame Holy Spirit within us, the fountain of both; and are eternally linked together: and ſo errour and vice. So that (all things truely weighed) no true doctrine can ever tend to an evil life, nor errour to a good: and Holineſs,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99134:109"/>alwaies ſuffers, not gains, by a lye. Therefore alſo are truth and iniquity frequently oppoſed -1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6. -<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. -1.18. So that no mans wickedneſs can be the effect or conſequent of any truth he holds: though who holds the truth may ſtill be wicked, from another principle in him. That therefore thus true and falſe teachers may be known by the fruit of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in their Auditors; if theſe tend to the infuſing into them higher degrees of all kinds of piety and charity; Or, on the contrary do infuſe any ſeeds of impiety, injuſtice, uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, ſenſual liberty, uncleanneſs, or ſedition, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Dignities and Superiors. This as to the fruit of their doctrines. But ſecondly, becauſe as to their perſons, the root in ſuch falſe teachers alwaies is evil; i. e. their affections and intentions are perverted, which perverſe affections at laſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelves in their lives and practices; theſe either for ſecular ends, teaching doctrines not believed, and known by them to be falſe, purpoſely to deceive, which ends and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy will certainly diſcover themſelves in their works; or tho the doctrines taught are alſo believed by them, yet there are ſome vicious inclinations reſpecting ſecular intereſts, which do induce ſuch a beleif (eſpecially where they depart from the Traditions of the Church, and former Superiours): and ſuch ſecular intereſts will appear in their works, and manners; and the heart, bad in one thing, will be ſo in another. Therefore the Apoſtles do deſcribe frequently ſuch falſe teachers, as viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their lives, and ſeducing with their fair ſpeeches (when in their ſheeps clothing) See <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18. -<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. -2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3, 13. -1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. -<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.11. -2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3, 10. &amp;c. in which texts they are repreſented as —<hi>Sibi placentes, gloriae ſitientes, aſſentatores, invidi, maledici &amp; obtrectatores, ventri dediti, ſuis temporalibus commodis &amp; avaritiae ſervientes (&amp; ſuum negocium agentes</hi> [ſome way or other]) <hi>non veritati:</hi> noting them ſpecially, as covetous, ſenſual, ſpeaking ill of Dignities. But here note, that by falſe Prophets are chiefly meant thoſe who know their doctrines to be falſe; and intend to deceive and teach in Hypocriſy, and live in diſobedience to a Superiour Church-authority. Otherwiſe ſome good man may teach an errour; and ſome bad, truth. But as theſe have or want the Grace of God in their heart, and have their will and affections ſincere or corrupt, ſo will their fruit moſtly be good, or bad; and among other things their teachings and inſtructions will have a reliſh thereof.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:99134:109"/>
               <p>After this our Lord concluded his whole Sermon thus; that the Foundation of Happineſs was their good works: and their not-hearing, or teaching, but doing, what he taught: which was laying the Foundation upon a ſure rock, ſo that no ſtorms ſhould ſhake the building raiſed upon it. But that the Hearer of his words, and not practicer, was like a fool building his houſe on ſand. Upon which a time would be, when the raines ſhould come, and the winds blow, and the floods ariſe, and the ſtorms beat vehemently upon it; and the fall thereof ſhould be very great and terrible. And thus ends our Lords great and famous Predication in the Mount, to his Apoſtles, and to all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who, ſaith the Evangeliſt, were much aſtoniſhed as at his doctrine, ſo at the manner of his delivery thereof; For he ſpake to them all theſe things with a kind of Majeſtical Authority, and not as the Scribes.</p>

Such Reſolution he ſhewed, when he took his leave of Galilee half a year before (<hi>Luk.</hi> 9.51. <hi>Dum complerentur dies aſſumptionis ejus, ipſe faciem ſuam firmavit, ut iret in Jeruſalem</hi>).

A Paſſage very punctually related by all the Evangeliſts, though Peters friends: That this example might remain for ever upon Regiſter, to ſhew the world what the beſt of men, what the very chief of the Apoſtles of God is, when in an hour of temptation, God's ſupporting grace is, for never ſo little time, withdrawn from him: that the higheſt Saints, to keep themſelves from falling, might learn to walk in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility and perpetual fear of falling; and might alſo learn to compaſſionate the falls they daily ſee of their weaker Brethren, and to bear with them their burdens <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2, 3. whilſt (as the Apoſtle) if any man whatever thinketh himſelf to be ſomething (except only our Lord, who ſtood in his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Thus leaving eight of his Diſciples (who perhaps might have bin apt to take ſome offence at the ſight of his Agonies) to their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, near the entrance of the Garden; and foreſeeing his own great deſolation of ſpirit approaching, he takes thoſe three of them more eſpecially loved, and familiarly treated by him,

But now, the bowels of God his Father (for the yearning of his bowels upon us) had no compaſſion on this righteous Job, ſtript firſt of all he had, even to his innermoſt veſture, nor on this onely Son, the King and heir of Heaven and Earth; but dy he muſt, and the manner thereof to be committed to the malitious contrivance of the Enemy of God and man.</p>

(As in all afflictions commonly the firſt aſſault is the moſt grievous, and leaſt ſupportable.) Where we are to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that not only a natural fear of Death ſeized on our Lord by the ſuſpending of other thoughts and conſiderations that might counterpoiſe it; but alſo a moſt extraordinary and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural deſolation and terror was brought upon his Spirit; and that thoſe divine conſolations, which God ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws from his Saints, (which hath left them in very great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, heartleſneſs and aridity, whereof they alſo make ſad complaints as of even the greateſt of mortal ſufferings) the ſame, but in a much higher Degree, were now by God, or by our Lord himſelf, withheld from his human nature, or from his lower-ſelf here in the Garden. For, had our Lord wanted theſe ſpiritual pangs, and theſe anguiſhes of his ſoul, he had wanted one of the greateſt (if not the very greateſt) ſufferings of mankind: beſides which inward Anguiſh, what external temptations alſo our Lords human Nature might ſuffer from

And we ſee, when ſome drops onely of the ſame ſtorm fell on the Diſciples, how ſoon they ſhrunk under them: not onely like us, then, he was in all our innocent infirmities, even thoſe of the ſoul and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections thereof, as well as thoſe of the body and ſenſes thereof, but far beyond us. That in all things, even in human miſeries, and in thoſe miſeries alſo, ſpiritual deſolations, ſo far as innocent, he might have the preeminence: and that out of the depth of this his humiliation might be raiſed a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation: and that alſo, how much greater in him the natural fear, and horrour of death ſeemed to be, ſo much more his love to us might be demonſtrated, that notwithſtanding for us he would ſo chearfully undergo it all. And, whereas his Divinity could ſo eaſily have hindered, or maſtered and diverted any ſuch tender apprehenſion and ſenſe of greif in the lower facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (which he doth alſo not unfrequently in his Martyrs; the joyes of their ſpirit and ſuperior part, drowning and intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Greif and Paines of the inferiour, whilſt the intenſiveneſs of the ſoul to one act diſenableth it as to all other) yet he, to march before us in all our greifs, voluntarily admitted alſo our ſorrows and anxieties of ſpirit to the higheſt Degree; that might include no Rebellion in it againſt the ſubjection due to Reaſon, and to God.</p>

In the Temple, then, certain devout Gentiles, by the divine providence now deſiring to be brought to him, and to be made acquainted with him, as it were, already ſuing to be admitted into his fold, which thing was only hindred by his death not as yet accompliſhed, our Lord took great notice of it: and upon this occaſion foretelling the coming in of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and how, aſſoon as he was once lifted up upon the Croſs; aſſoon as this ſtandard was erected, and he diſplayed upon it, he ſhould draw all the world unto him.

And this for his own ſake too, to ſpend it in prayer to be delivered from that great temptation, that was coming, eſpecially on Peter.

Where alſo by his mentioning the weakneſs, and infirmity of their Fleſh (which he now alſo felt extraordinarily in himſelf, but without ſin) he excites them alſo to a ſtronger vigilancy over it. Then
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99134:117"/>repeating again to them the ſame charge of watching to praier in this dreadful hour of temptation, which he gave them before, He departs again to a certain diſtance, ſore preſt with that great weight that lay upon him; and on his knees made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time the ſame requeſt with an earneſtneſs of Praier <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.24. increaſing according to his Agony; when alſo his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent words conclude again in the ſame manner; —<hi>Not my will, My Father, but thine be done.</hi> And as S.

Thus ſolitary, and deſtitute of any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his ſorrow, not anſwered by his Father, nor his Friends, here thoſe complaints of the Pſalmiſt are verifyed, which he ſpake of him in this his ſtate of Deſolation <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. <hi>voce ſua ad Dominum clamavit, voce ſua ad Dominum deprecatus eſt.

And (could we now go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) what world can there be ſo numerous, or its ſins ſo great, that the only Son of God might not end his Paſſion here; and offer only this, as over-ſufficient to redeem it; and thus pay the due ſufferings, in ſuch an afflictive Deprecation of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99134:118"/>more ſufferings before its diſſolution. When methinks in great confuſion, this his Vaſſal prefaceth to him in ſome ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as his ſervant John did at his Baptiſm; <hi>Lord, I live, and move, and have my being by thee, and muſt my Lord thus be ſtrengthned by me?</hi> To whom this anſwer ſeems to be returned: <hi>I Permit it to be ſo now; For thus it is meet to fulfil all ſufferings, and to give my Servants an Example of diſdaining help from none of Gods Creatures, though in Dignity never ſo inferior to them.</hi> This Angel then (ſome think the chiefeſt, S.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label> Thrice our Lord iterated this his requeſt (the firſt compleat Plurality of number arguing ſome importunity) and ſo thrice did his ſervant Paul afterwards iterate his, for Deliverance from another temptation: the Practice of them both being ſuch, as our Lord had before preſcribed to his Diſciples in the parable of the importunate Widdow, and neceſſitous Neighbor. Thrice both prayed, and both Denyed, as to the firſt matter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Prayer, concluded in the Sacrifice of their own will unto God's, and in a holy Reſignation much more meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beneficial to them, than had bin the granting of their firſt requeſt. Inſtead of which both received another Grant much better, viz. of the divine conſolations and joy in their ſufferings, which they petitioned to have had removed; S. Paul by our Lord 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. ſpeaking to him; our Lord by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſpeaking to him <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. And thus both their prayers were heard, as all thoſe of all Saints, rightly made with the clauſe of Reſignation, alwaies are. And God ever upon ſuch Prayers ſtraight gives ſome new thing to the ſuppliant; either ſome new thing without him, or ſome new thing within him: either Grants externally the thing prayed for, or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth internally (for he is omnipotent) the deſire of the perſon praying for it. Thus he, who perfectly reſigns his own Will to God's, hath at laſt his own will, becauſe it is God's; and God's will now ſo far his, that, to grant him his former Will, would be a thing againſt his will: and giving to him his paſt, would be but a denial of his preſent, deſires. And far better and more ſatisfying ſeems this change of our mind within us, than of the world, or its affairs without us. (Wherein alſo Gods courſe is many times unalterable by our Prayers). For our <hi>mind</hi> to us is all in all, and not the things without us. Joy, and ſorrow, Pain, and pleaſure, lodg here, and the heavenly Phyſitian works the ſhorter cure, when we come to him for ſome eaſe, in applying his medicines to the ſoul it ſelf; and in altering, and with his Cordials ſtrengthning, and ſupporting it, than in altering exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things for its ſatisfaction. And when we beg theſe things to content it, he doth not deceive us if he give the ſame content to it without them, or alſo in the contrary to them: and it ſeems to come all to one, either to receive, or poſſeſs a thing,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99134:119"/>or not at all to want or deſire it; or alſo, now to deſire to want it. And S. Paul, after our Lord's ſpeaking to him, and his new Grace given him, was as much ſatisfyed and tranſported, and took as much pleaſure in his infirmities, which he would have had removed, and in the thorne ſticking in his Fleſh, as if he had had it, at his requeſt, pulled out. Eſpecially if this alſo be put into the Scale, That God, in denying any preſent Good wiſhed for, preſents alwaies to us the poſſeſſion of a future good (much more valuable) in the ſame kind; and indeed denyes this preſent good in order to our attaining this future; and alſo, for the preſent, feeds the mind, in its inſtant preſſures, with moſt ſtrong hopes thereof, and conſolations therein. And thus it is declared of our Lord himſelf in this matter <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. —That <hi>for the Joy that was ſet before him he endured the Croſs.</hi>

By this, as it were fore-pitying his great Damnation, to reduce him now at leaſt to ſome reflection upon his bloody Treaſon, and proſtrate himſelf at his feet to beg pardon.

Our Lord being ſet before them, the High Prieſt, inſtead of producing a charge againſt him, and hearing his Defence and Anſwer to it, fell on Queſtioning him about his Doctrine, and his Followers, (whom, as they had ſaid elſewhere, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.16. they knew free to ſpeak truth; and, as to this, regarding, or fearing no mans Perſon) to ſee what he would confeſs; and, if confeſſing any thing liable to their cenſure, thence to draw up an Indictment; when as indeed this ſeemed very great oppreſſion, to apprehend, bind, make a man a Priſoner, and bring him before the barr of Juſtice, there to gain from him ſomething, for which to queſtion him. Our Lord, having many times before bin thus examined by them or their order, who he was, who ſent him, what authority he had, &amp;c. anſwered them briefly; That, both for Doctrine and Diſciples, they had ſeen who theſe, and heard what that, was; (and indeed if the latter, his Doctrine, good, the more Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the better); That he had taught publickly in the Temple, and in their Synagogues, and in private ſaid nothing, but what abroad.

But theſe alſo, in reciting of his words, varyed, as from the truth of what our Lord ſaid, ſo from one another. One teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99134:123"/>that he ſaid abſolutely he would deſtroy it: <hi>Deſtruam; Mark.</hi> 14.58. The other, that he could, or was able to deſtroy it, in the ſpace of three dayes.

One witneſſed in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, That he ſaid, he would deſtroy the Temple; but then, he might mean ſome other Temple; as indeed he did, the Temple of his Body: but the other, that he ſaid he would deſtroy the Temple made with hands, that very Temple of Jeruſalem; and that, in three daies alſo, he would undertake to build it up again <hi>(reaedificabo);</hi> whereas his own words, ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of the Temple of his body, was <hi>excitabo.</hi> Thus they urged againſt him <hi>things that he knew not Pſalm.</hi> 34.11. and laid to his charge things that he never meant. But, then, his ſaying, he was <hi>able to deſtroy it,</hi> ſeems only a vaunting and vain-glorious ſpeech, not deſerving death or bonds: and, it he ſaid further, that he would do it, this argued only a malitious intention where no poſſibility of acting. Words they were alſo ſpoken ſome years before, without attempting any ſuch thing in the leaſt afterwards: Nay one of his valianteſt acts, and wherein he moſt ſhewed his power was quite contrary to it, the cleanſing of the ſame Temple from any profanation of it, in the leaſt manner, even in the outward Courts thereof: of which there wanted not Witneſſes many, who ſuffered by it.

But, alas, theſe words (now in the ſcarcity of any other ſolid accuſation ſo aggravated) were before, at the time he ſpake them, even according to the Jews underſtanding them, only ſlighted as a a vain brag, and not thought liable to bear an action: they then replying to him, that he ſpake impoſſibilities; for that a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that had been before forty ſix years in building, could not by one perſon ſo ſpeedily be pulled down or reedifyed. <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.20.</p>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99134:134"/>[perhaps relating to his laſt triumphal entrance into the City five daies before on Palm-Sunday, <hi>Pauper &amp; humilis,</hi> riding upon a poor young colt of an Aſſe without a Saddle, and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he went along; and a great part of his applauſe, the Hoſannas of the children]. Now Galilee was a place noted formerly for ſeveral rebellions. See <hi>Acts</hi> 5.37, 38. how one Theudas appeared there that made himſelf a Prophet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he could do miracles, and drew much people after him (mentioned but mis-timed by Joſephus <hi>Antiq. Judaic. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.); and, after him, Judas of Galilee about the birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the time of the enrolment under Cyrenius <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.2. which Judas alſo oppoſed the paying of taxes or tribute to the Romans: Both which Rebels and all their Followers were diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and deſtroyed. After theſe alſo it ſeems ſome Galileans within a few years before had ſo highly offended Pilat in his government, that, when they came up to Jeruſalem at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſt to offer Sacrifice, he cauſed them to be put to death; and that in ſome cruel, ſuddain, and unexpected manner, it ſhould ſeem by the expreſſion in the Text <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.1: and, by their relating it to our Lord, ſome think they might be ſome relicks of Judas his Sect that denyed tribute to Ceſar (for which reaſon alſo ſome made mention of them to our Lord to hear his judgment of their opinion) and that made at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſome oppoſition in the Feaſt to the Sacrificing for the ſafety and proſperity of the Emperour. And Pilat is noted both by <hi>Philo Judeus De legatione ad Caium</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> to have bin <hi>pervicaci &amp; duro ingenio,</hi> and very uncompliant with the Jews; and who at laſt, complained-of by the Nation to <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> then a Superior Prefect of Syria, for a ſlaughter made upon the Galileans, was ſent by him to Ceſar to give an account thereof; and ſo deprived of his government and confined. The Jews mention therefore hereof Galilee ſeems to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced much to their purpoſe. But, when this was ſuggeſted to Pilat, he made another uſe of it; and though Herod and he were now at enmity between themſelves, perhaps for Pilat's cruelty ſhewed to the Galileans forementioned: yet reſolved to ſend to him the Priſoner, who was born, as was commonly imagined, his Subject (Galilee being under Herods juriſdiction) and lived moſt of his time in his territories; as being deſirous to rid his hands of this buſineſs with as little diſpleaſure to the Jews as might be, and to devolve the odium of it upon Herod, now come up to the Feaſt; and, becauſe Herod being
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99134:134"/>well acquainted with the Jews law and Religion (which alſo he profeſt) might better diſcover the Juſtice of the quarrel the Jews had againſt him about his Meſſiasſhip, and the <hi>Truth</hi> he ſaid he came to promulgate; and would perhaps protect him, as his Subject, againſt the High Prieſts malice. Thus Satan, to whom God gave leave to perſecute his only Son, not excepting his life as he did Job's, hurried our Lord as it were in Triumph, to prolong his ſufferings, before inflicting the laſt, of death, from one great perſon to another, to make him the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick object of ſcorn and contempt; and, that all might have an hand in his afflictions and torments, the Court of Galilee, as well as that of Judea: foretold by David <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Principes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venerunt in unum, adverſus Chriſtum tuum;</hi> and obſerved by S.

But Herod little regarded their clamours, as one who had well bin inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Lord's actions, and integrity; and, being a crafty Fox (as our Lord once ſtiled him) had formerly watched him very narrowly: and his Jealouſy, as the Phariſee truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our Lord, wanted only ſome fair occaſion to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him. But his generally doing all manner of good, and giving heavenly counſel, without Wealth, without Arms, preaching only humility and patience, working alſo great cures, ejecting Devils &amp;c. (our Lords Apology for himſelf when the Phariſee told him, Herod would kill him), as alſo ſending his Diſciples abroad without any weapon for their defence, were things this Tyrant could not make criminous. But, from ſuch his ſilence, conceiving him without wit to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and to ſhew he had no jealouſy of his Crown from ſuch a poor Rival, thought fit only to make ſport with him, and treat him as a Fool and a Mock-King; for his Kingſhip was the thing his Accuſers moſt preſſed. And ſo after he himſelf, reſenting his ſilence, had ſhewed ſome ſcorn and neglect of him, he gave order to his men of war to array this their new King according to his dignity in a white Garment, the Ornament of Prieſts and Princes, ſome old caſt-off Robe taken out of his wardrobe: and, after much jeering and ſlighting of him, and ſome <hi>Giuoco di Mano's</hi> doubtleſs mixed, the like uſage to that received over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night from the High Prieſts Officers, he returned him in this dreſs to Pilat, with his Guards commanded to wait upon his Majeſty; and the people deriding and hooting at him as he paſſed, according to the Prophecy concerning him <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Omnes videntes me deriſerunt me: locuti ſunt labiis, &amp; moverunt caput.</hi> But Herod by this dreſs ſufficiently ſignifyed his mind to Pilat, that his perſon was rather an object of ſcorn or pity, then of his Juſtice; which no doubt gave little ſatisfaction to the cruel Higſt Prieſts, in whom neither Pilat's nor Herod's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving him, nor yet the admirable meekneſs of our Lord (who, they well knew, wanted not words to defend his Innocency; and who by his ſilence ſeemed to conſpire with them againſt

And indeed, if we conſider the perſon he now took on him, what Malefactor or crimes ſo great, as could match him, or his? for he carried on his ſhoulders all the ſins of the whole world, preſent, and paſt, and to come, and even thoſe too of theſe Malefactors; and ſo alſo this Anathema, as the chief, was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the midſt; and the reaſon in the Prophet of his <hi>cum ſceleratis reputatus</hi> ſeems very appoſite, —<hi>quia &amp; ipſe peccata multorum tulit.</hi> Graced with this company, and laden with an heavy Croſs, the long beam thereof being probably more than twice the length of a man; for his body was to be ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at its full length upon it; and to be exalted to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient height, as might render him a ſpectacle to all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and <hi>de facto</hi> ſo high it was, that the Soldier to pierce his ſide uſed not his Sword, but his Lance; and, to give him drink they tyed a ſpunge to the end of a long reed, and ſo reached it to his mouth; It was alſo to carry a Title over his head, and to be faſtned in the ground; and the croſs Beam of it alſo was to equal the breadth of his body and length of his arms; I ſay, thus laden, he made a painful, but moſt chearful, march under it through a good part of the City; (the Governours Palace being near the Temple on the Eaſt ſide of it; and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary the place of Execution at the North-Weſt ſide thereof) till, when coming without the Gate, he fainted away under it; his body being now grown very feeble, and his ſpirits exhauſted, by reaſon of his cruel ſcourging, and other baſe uſage of the

               <p>Becauſe our Lord alone was unable to bear it any further, and it was an ignominious thing to carry or touch the inſtrument of the Execution of a Malefactor, whence the word <hi>Furcifer</hi> was a common name of reproach, by chance a poor man, that came then out of the countrey, one <hi>Simon</hi> a ſtranger; of <hi>Cyrene</hi> in Africk, where was then a great Colony of the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.10. —6.9. <hi>Joſeph. de Excid.

But the divine Counſel ordained this accident thus ſignificative alſo of a greater matter; viz. That our Lord would not bear his croſs alone, but that all his Followers for ever were to bear their parts of it.</p>

Eſpecially amongſt theſe the Bleſſed Virgin, his afflicted Mother, who could not be abſent from him in life, or death, where ſhe could have any acceſs, and who, here, moſt diligently obſerved all her Son ſaid, or did, or that was done to him; as the Evangeliſt ſaith <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.19. ſhe formerly did thoſe even in his minority and childhood; ſhe, I ſay, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, may be ſuppoſed to be wounded at the heart, not only when ſhe ſtood by the Croſs, but, during all this time, with thoſe Sword-points of moſt pungent Grief (which Simeon foretold her of) in her and the reſt of her Friends hearing their <hi>away with this fellow;</hi> and their <hi>crucifiges,</hi> and their acclamations for <hi>Barabbas,</hi> before the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And the ſight of him ſo uſed, when Pilat cried <hi>Ecce Homo,</hi> and again <hi>Ecce Rex Veſter,</hi> that had no operation of pity upon the hard-hearted Jews, I may ſay had too much on them. But that we are to believe his Holy Mother, as being full of Grace, and of the Holy Ghoſt, to have bin indued with a moſt perfect patience, and reſignation, and ſilence; and her carriage alſo to have bin an edifying pattern to the reſt.

And thus a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude attended our Lord his death and Funeral full of bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99134:145"/>though amongſt theſe the more or more open in their grief were thoſe of the female Sex.</p>

The conſideration of which had but a few daies before drawn tears alſo from himſelf; when the Evangeliſt ſaith, he, in the midſt of his triumph from Mount Olivet, beholding the City, wept over it, ſaying with ſobbs interrupting his ſpeech, <hi>If that thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt, in this thy day &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 19.41.

On the right ſide of which Sepulcher from the entrance the Sacred body of our Lord was placed, ſee <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.5. compared <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.12, with his head toward the Weſt. After this the door or mouth of the Cave was ſhut up, and fenced with a maſſy piece of rock cut out for the purpoſe; not to be removed but by the help of many hands; to hinder any violation of the Sepulcher, or Body; or robbing it of thoſe coſtly linnen and ſpices, that ſhould be beſtowed upon it. Such a cave it was, where Lazarus was buried, <hi>Jo.</hi> 11.38, 31, 41. with a great Stone rolled upon the entrance into it; which our Lord then commanded to be removed; and our Lords raiſing of him, a lively type of the ſame thing he would ſhortly after perform in raiſing himſelf. Meanwhile, thoſe women, our Lords former Diſciples and Attendants, that aſſiſted not in this action, keeping ſome diſtance, perhaps in reſpect of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſons, with whom they had no acquaintance, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all that was done, where their Lord was laid, and how the Sepulcher made faſt: and, it being now too late, becauſe night approached, they intended, after the Sabbath ended, to expreſs their laſt love and affection to ther dear Lord alſo, in bringing ſome more ſweet odours and ſpices for preſerving and perfuming of his Sacred body, and the narrow roome, where it lay; more to ſhew the honour and devotion they bare to it, and once more to behold, to touch, and kiſs thoſe moſt holy Relicks, than that there was now need of any more ſuch coſt.</p>

Thus, I ſay, our ſo cruelly murthered Lord was now at reſt, but not ſo the conſciences of the Phariſees and High Prieſts. Whoſe ſeeing theſe two noble perſons Joſeph and Nicodemus, thro ſo much popular hate, to have ſo honourably interred his Body, gave them a great jealouſy: and the predictions alſo about his riſing again the third day much diſturbed them. Though, a thing, which was quite forgotten by our Lords Diſciples and Followers, who, one would think, had moſt cauſe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred it, and which he had ſo often told them of; and they had, upon hearing it from him, alſo diſputed amongſt themſelves, what ſhould be meant by it, as they deſcended from the holy Mount, after our Lord's Transfiguration: and, after this again, were by him minded of it but the night before his paſſion, as they went along to the Garden; he telling them then alſo, that, when riſen, he would go before them into Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.32. I ſay this, forgotten by them, yet now very much troubled and diſquieted the thoughts of the High Prieſts. They could now call to mind, how, when they asked him a ſign once and again <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.38.16.4. he alleged to them that of Jonah; and that the Son of man, as Jonah in the Whales bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould lye three daies in the heart of the earth, and ſo be caſt up again, and the jaws of Death not be able to detain him; And his ſaying, that, if they deſtroyed the Temple, meaning his Body, after three daies he would raiſe it up; which ſpeech of his, though before they made it (miſconſtrued by them) an Article to condemn him, yet now they could apprehend in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and its right, ſenſe; and might thereby have condemned themſelves: Now alſo perhaps the words of our Lord ſpoken with ſo much Majeſty before them at his arraignment ran in their mind, that they ſhould ſhortly ſee him ſitting on the right hand of Power: and laſtly, the obſequious reſpects, they ſaw given to his body by thoſe two eminent perſons, they conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might ariſe from ſome ſuch hopes; and were performed from ſome ſuch expectation. Remembring therefore theſe predictions, and perhaps not free from all fears of ſuch an event, after having beheld ſuch wonderful things at, and before, his death, they thought it meet, at leaſt to prevent any cheat in the buſineſs; and to hinder that his Diſciples might not, upon
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:99134:156"/>ſuch rumour of his riſing again, to deceive the credulous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, remove ſecretly his body, and ſo ſhew the empty Sepulcher, and ſuborn ſome to ſay they had ſeen him  though indeed no reaſon they had to ſuſpect any ſuch thing, but rather that his Diſciples, if finding his words falſe, would at leaſt recant their former error, and confeſs him an Impoſtor and a falſe Prophet. Therefore they haſted again to Pilat, for all that it was the Sabbath, it being late over night before they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his ſolemn and ſumptuous Burial, and relating to him theſe predictions, and the bad conſequence that might be of them, importuned him that there might be ſet a watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sepulcher till the third day: and, as if jealous alſo of the corruption of the Watch, that the Sepulcher might be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides. But why this ſeal? becauſe, if the body were taken away, there muſt be a breach of the ſeal, and ſo this theft diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered? But ſo would there be a breach of it, if the body riſen again. For, how could they imagine, that that power which raiſed the body, might or would not alſo throw open the door for its paſſage? But this Seal ſerved well, meanwhile, to ſave it from the pillage of the Soldiers, and to guard it from the Guards. Some Antients ſay, that the ſtone was by them faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Sepulcher with iron. Theſe things were done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by themſelves, the Governour leaving this wholly to their own ordering; and doubtleſs much wondring at theſe their extravagant jealouſies and fears. So, to the Monument they go, ſet this Guard, and ſeal the ſtone, and this with no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that it was on the Sabbath; of the breach of which, but by better works ſurely than theſe, they had ſo often, ſo heavily, accuſed our good Lord. But all this their diligence by the Divine providence was turned quite contrary to their intents; and rendred our Lords Reſurrection much more clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whilſt this very Guard were the firſt witneſſes of it; and that to the High Prieſts themſelves; and quite took away the pretence, which elſe they might not only have reported, but verily believed, of his Diſciples carrying away his body. Which witneſs of the Watch doubtleſs confirmed the faith of many, who would not give ſo eaſy credit to the Diſciples Teſtimony of it; and was a means of converting ſome of the High Prieſts alſo. And their teſtifying likewiſe our Lords prediction of it before Pilat ſtill added more to the truth and reputation of this Event. Of all which Daniels being caſt into the den of Lyons, and the entrance into it being ſealed by his Enemies, that no

A day advanced ever ſince this act into the ſolemn Feſtival of Chriſtians in an eternal memory of the joy of this day. Early on this day our Lord reſumed, and clothed with immortality, that moſt Sacred body of his that had before ſo highly merited it by paſſing through ſo many cruel torments. Here alſo great Multitudes of Angels attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this our Lord in their white and ſhining Robes, as may be gathered by their frequent apparitions within and without the Sepulcher, and the women's diſcription of them. And, ſince a multitude of the heavenly Hoſt appeared praiſing God at our Lords Nativity, and the beginning of his Humiliation, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine leſs ſolemnities at the beginning of his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triumph; whom alſo we had found before waiting on him, at his former conqueſt over Satan with prayer and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Deſert. And, if they ſhew their Joy at the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſinner, how much more now did they at the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world? And by theſe, or by our Lord, at his riſing, and for a clear argument alſo of it, the linnen clothes wherein our Lord lay (the only prey which a Robber would have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after) were decently folded up, and the Napkin about his head, as if taken off after them, laid in a diverſe place from the reſt.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, as before at our Lords death, happened a terrible Earthquake. And an Angel of great Majeſty, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance like lightning, ſaith the Evangeliſt, and his raiment white as Snow, was ſeen by the aſtoniſhed Guards to deſcend and roll away the ſtone, ſo to expoſe the open Sepulcher to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones view, after our Lords glorious Body had already paſſed through it, when yet ſhut up and ſealed.

So terrible was this ſight, as alſo the Earthquake, that the Soldiers (though they fell not into a ſleep, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward reported, yet) fell into a ſwoon, and became for a while, ſaith the Evangeliſt, as dead men <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.4. After ſome time recovering a little ſtrength, and ſeeing the Sepulcher thrown open, the body gone, and only the linnen clothes and ſpices wrapt up and left behind (which though it had bin much for their intereſt, or excuſe, in raiſing a report of its being ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away, as well as profit to have taken, and their neceſſity but two daies before had ſhared his former garments) yet they durſt not touch, but from the Angel's preſence ſpeedily fled away: and in a great fright ſome of them came to the chief Prieſts and related all that had hapned; our Lords Body gone, the Sepulcher empty, the linnens and ſpices left behind, (touch them he that durſt) the terrible apparition of the Angel, with an Earthquake, breaking their ſeal and rolling away the ſtone, and there ſtaying and ſitting upon it.</p>

And, becauſe the negligence of theſe Guards confeſſing themſelves to ſleep, when they ſhould have watched, if coming to the Governours ears, was highly puniſhable; the chief Prieſts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged alſo, that in any ſuch accident they would ſatisfy the Governour, and ſecure them: conſidering well, if they could not ſmother and hide the truth in this matter, the publick odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um and loſs of reputation, which they ſhould incur both with the People and the Governour, in their proſecuting ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, againſt the inclinations of both theſe, the death (to ſay no more) of ſo juſt and innocent a perſon.

But no mention is there of our Lords Mother the Bleſſed Virgin amongſt them; and the reaſon why ſhe, who had a much greater love to, and grief for, her Son, than any other, yet was not ſo active as they in expreſſing it ſeems to be; either that John, to whoſe prudent care ſhe was committed, had reſtrained her return to the Sepulcher, ſo to put ſome bounds to her grief, and that this might not add ſorrow to ſorrow; or rather becauſe both the faith of his Reſurrection, before it came to paſs, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diminiſhed or ecclipſed in her (who alſo full of Grace laid up in her heart all our words, and well remembred what others forgot); and alſo becauſe moſt probably our Lords conſolation of her, ſo ſoon as he was riſen, was not at all deferred; but that by his immediat apparition to her he afforded her an early recompence of her former ſuffering thoſe ſword-points of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at his Croſs, and alſo of the faith, which in her alone wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not at that time, as in the reſt.

This was no ſooner done, but they perceived their Net ſo ponderous with the fiſhes it had encloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, not able to lift it up into the ſhip, they were forced to drag it along toward the ſhore. Upon which St. John ſaid to Peter, that certainly it was our Lord, either by his quicker ſight better diſcerning him; or from this great Miracle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereof. Peter, according to his wonted fervour and courage, and moved by an extraordinary love he bare to our Lord, impatient of the ſlow motion of the Ship, dragging gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the laden Net, girding only cloſe to him his Fiſhers coat without further apparelling himſelf, threw himſelf into the Sea, it being not far to the ſhore.

Simon Peter being both the cheif of them, and alſo one, who now had ſhewed an extraordinary love and devotion to him, when, being as yet hardly diſcovered by him, he threw himſelf into the Sea, not minding his fiſh, for haſt to come to him.</p>
               <p>Him, then, he kindly beſpake on this manner. Simon Bar-Jona loveſt thou me more than theſe?

If thou doſt, ſaith he, now I the chief Paſtor am quitting this world, and leaving them to others, feed my Lambs; theſe little ones, who as yet are but Neophytes in, and newly acquainted with, the Chriſtian Faith; our Lord ſhewing herein the bowels of his affection not only to the twelve, but alſo thoſe others formerly inſtructed by him; And <hi>Qui redempti ſunt pretio magno.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20.</p>
               <p>Now, to St. Peter our Lord commits here more particularly the feeding of them, becauſe he was ordained by God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the chief and prime Paſtor of them, under Chriſt: And therefore elſewhere, at the firſt ſight of him (no doubt from the divine ordination) he gave him the name of Cephas, Stone, or Foundation <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.42: though Andrew the firſt called, and, ſome ſay, the Elder Brother. And again, upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Confeſſion he made, by God the Fathers revealing it

And again, at his Paſſion, Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted by God to tempt our Lords Diſciples, he made ſome particular interceſſion for the not failing of S.

And, as, here, he enjoines him the feeding of his ſheep; ſo, there alſo, he recommends to him the confirmation of this faith in the other his Fellow-ſhepheards of theſe ſheep; —<hi>Tu converſus confirma fratres.</hi> And, to this ſpecial Commiſſion here given to Peter over our Lords Flock, S.

Paul, more than by any other, for the converſion of Gentiles. Tho, for the Gentiles alſo, the honour of the firſt converſion of them was given to S. Peter; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. —15.7. And, as S.

               <p>Our Lord, to make this charge effect the deeper impreſſion on Peter, and all his Succeſſors, ceaſed not thus; but repeated it; asking him again and again (only omitting the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) till Peter was grieved, <hi>Jo.</hi> 21.17. and aſhamed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he loved him; and, upon the ſame Anſwer of his, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Lords omniſcience, made now three times (from whom our Lord may ſeem to require this trinal confeſſion to expiate and reverſe his former trinal Denyal) he thrice iterated to him the ſame charge, that in the abſence of himſelf he ſhould return this love to his little ones; whom he ſometimes called Lambs, ſometimes Sheep, to ſhew all in his fold, old or young

               <p>After our Lord had thus inſtructed this chief Servant and Steward of his houſhold, Peter, what he ſhould do, he began to preacquaint him alſo with what he ſhould ſuffer, for him, the more to pre-arm him for future Events; and that, nothing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unexpected, or that was not known to be by the divine Providence predeſigned; ſuch things might afterwards leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe him; and that the conceit of a preſent ſecular Kingdom of our Lord, and their advancement in his Court, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of his mind. He then began to tell him, with a double ſerious <hi>Amen</hi> pronounced before it; That, as in his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger age he had gone whither, and done what, he pleaſed, ſo hereafter in his old age he muſt expect a change: That, as he muſt undertake great labours for his ſake, ſo undergo great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and be made like unto his Maſter he ſo loved,<note place="margin">

Which accordingly happened in the thirteenth year of Nero, after he had diligently fed Chriſt's ſheep, after this (<hi>tranſiens univerſa,</hi> viſiting all places <hi>Acts</hi> 9.32.) for thirty five years.</p>
